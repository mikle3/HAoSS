        <h1>Arina Kokina</h1>
        <p>Arina Kokina is a former student of <a href="./ISL.html">The Island School</a> that was a member of <a href="./2027B.html">Grade 10B</a>. She is known for her writings and her chocolate obsession.</p>
        <p>Arina Kokina started studying at The Island School on the <a href="./20230911.html">11th of September, 2023</a> (in the 9th Grade).</p>
        <p>Now Arina is studying at the <a href="./European_Gymnasium.html">European Gymnasium</a> in Moscow.</p>
        <p>Arina is friends with <a href="./Aleksandra_Zhukova.html">Aleksandra Zhukova</a> and other girls from <a href="./2027.html">Grade 2027</a>. She is also friends with <a href="./Godfather.html">Eugeniy Kolesov</a>, but not with <a href="./Ian_Shumilin.html">Ian Shumilin</a>.</p>
        <p>In 2023 Arina with some other classmates united for the <a href="./Book_Writers.html">Book Community Project</a>. She (allegedly) was in the Writers team.</p>
        <p>In 2024 Arina understood that she likes bookwriting projects. So she decided to make another book for her Personal Project called <a href="./Leap_In_The_Wrong_Direction.html">Leap In The Wrong Direction</a>. Since it was a Personal Project, she wrote the text alone. But she collaborated with <a href="./Vasilisa_Matafonova.html">Vasilisa Matafonova</a> and <a href="./Sofia_Zanti.html">Sofia Zanti</a> for the design. Vasilisa drawed illustrations (allegedly in ProCreate) and Sofia did the layout in Adobe InDesign.</p>

        <h1>Summer Camp 2025</h1>
        <p>Arina participated in the Summer Camp 2025. She was one of <a href="./Camp_2025_not_sleepers.html">few people</a> who didn't sleep at night. She said that she didn't sleep because it was the last sleepover with her classmate friends.</p>

        <h1>Insignificant events</h1>
        <p>In November of 2024 <a href="./Tagir_Zainulin.html">Mr. Tagir</a> assigned a group task to Grade 10B. Arina got into a group with <a href="./Mikhail_Bukach.html">Mikhail Bukach</a>, <a href="./Yury_Mironenko.html">Yury Mironenko</a> and <a href="./Yulia_Zhurava.html">Yulia Zhurava</a>. The task was to create 3 factual, 2 conceptual and 1 debatable questions from a specific video. As Yury remembers, at the end Arina and Yulia didn't come to the lesson due to theater rehersals (see: <a href="./Alladin_2024.html">Alladin 2024</a>). Fun fact: when creating a group in Telegram, Misha forgot who of Zhuravas he was in group with.</p>
        <p>On February 19-21 2025 Grade 10 had an interdisciplinary<sup>[allegedly]</sup> unit about ancient Greek theater. Students were divided into 3 groups. Arina got into a group with <a href="./Mikhail_Bukach.html">Mikhail Bukach</a>, <a href="./Margarita_Kolenchits.html">Margarita Kolenchits</a>, <a href="./Tymur_Marchenko.html">Tymur Marchenko</a>, <a href="./Yury_Mironenko.html">Yury Mironenko</a>, <a href="./Alina_Zhurava.html">Alina Zhurava</a> and <a href="./Yulia_Zhurava.html">Yulia Zhurava</a>. The task was to create a short play from Aristophanes' "Frogs". Arina's group made a boat from a cardboard box that Yury found near his house on the street.</p>

        <h1>Future plans</h1>
        <p>Arina said that in February 2026 she may come to Cyprus to celebrate her birthday.</p>
